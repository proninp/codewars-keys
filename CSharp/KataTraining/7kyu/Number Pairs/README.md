# Number Pairs

In this kata the aim is to compare each pair of integers from two arrays, and return a new array of large numbers.

Note: Both arrays have the same dimensions.

## Example:
```csharp
arr1 = new int[] { 13, 64, 15, 17, 88 };
arr2 = new int[] { 23, 14, 53, 17, 80 };

Kata.getLargerNumbers(arr1, arr2); // Returns {23, 64, 53, 17, 88}
```
